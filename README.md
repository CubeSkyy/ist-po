# Objected-Oriented Programming Project

Simple project to control Services that provide Iteneraries used by Passengers.

Specificaly:
* The creation and retrieval of all required domain objects, given some filtered gets and whatnot
* Data serialization, so data is not lost on program exit.
* CLI to interact with the requested methods
* Parsing input files
* Built with extension in mind
